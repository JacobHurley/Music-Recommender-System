# Music-Recommender-System
 
Data was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/undefinenull/million-song-dataset-spotify-lastfm/data
Data was then stored in a "Data" folder so the code accesses through 'Data/...'. Because these files are too large, we can not store them in the repository

This project attempts to create a recomendation system for spotify music based on user and song Data.
The 2 methods attempted here are item-item similarity and matrix factorization using Non-negative Matrix factorization(NMF) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
